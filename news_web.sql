But the following day, the occupants – mostly businessmen who had worked late - would rise up and head back to the office, grateful for this efficient sleep solution that had saved them a commute home in the early hours.  \r\n\r\nAs the concept spread, tourists happy to sleep in a room no bigger than its bed began to bunk up alongside them, eager to sample this unusual aspect of Japanese culture. Fast-forward to today, and high hotel room rates, fuelled by years of rising real estate prices, have supercharged this typically low-cost concept, which offers budget travellers priced out of traditional hotels more privacy than a hostel dormitory and more comfort and connectivity than camping. The capsules, which are predominantly single-occupancy, also answer the current boom in solo travel, with single-sex capsule hotels providing additional security.\r\n\r\nWith the global capsule hotel market projected to reach $327m by 2031, curious hybrids have emerged to sustain the trend and attract new customers. They\'re tempting the TikTok generation with increasingly outlandish forms, from upcycled sewer pipes in the Colombian desert to space-age pods with a dashboard of ambient controls in downtown Sydney, Australia – all promising a unique experience and shareable stories for social media. Meanwhile capsule-cum-bookstores invite book lovers to snooze among the shelves, and boutique versions bring luxury to a traditionally no-frills market with fancy decor or promises of fluffy duck-feather duvets.\r\n\r\nAs the concept continues to reinvent itself, here are eight of the most extraordinary examples.\r\n\r\n', '2025-02-04 16:59:11'),

(Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)\r\n\r\nThe co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.\r\n\r\nGates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".\r\n\r\nHis Foundation\'s 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.\r\n\r\nHe tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn\'t actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn\'t order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.\r\n\r\nHe plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.\r\n\r\nWill they be poor after he\'s gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they\'ll do well, in percentage terms it\'s not a gigantic number\".\r\n\r\nGates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.\r\n\r\nMaths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you\'re worth $160bn, which Bloomberg\'s Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.', '2025-02-04 17:03:47');
